This directory contains 5 subdirectories for 5 test cases,
described in detail in Paper III, Chap. 6.

All the tests can be run using the shell script Runtest,
located in this directory. This script does all the
necessary links to atomic data. It calls another script,
RTlusty, that is present in the main directory of the Tlusty 
distribution (one directory above the present).

The only action the user needs to do is to set up
an environment variable TLUSTY that specifies this directory.
For instance, if the tar file with the Tlusty distribution,
tlusty205.tar was extracted in the home directory,
thus creating the main Tlusty directory as   ~/tlusty205
then one has to set

aetenv TLUSTY ~/tlusty205


The individual subdirectories contain all the necesary
input files, plus some output files with names *.orig
for comparison of the user's run to a run performed on
Ivan Hubeny's MacBook Pro laptop.
